SYNOPSIS

   package MyApp;

   use Gtk2::GladeXML::Simple;
   use base qw( Gtk2::GladeXML::Simple )

   sub new {
      my $class = shift;
      my $self = $class->SUPER::new( $gladefile ); 
      return $self;
   }

   ...

   # Signal handlers are methods of your class
   sub on_button_clicked {
      my $self = shift;
      # You have access to your widgets directly

   }        

DESCRIPTION

   Gtk2::Glade::XML::Simple is a module that provides a clean and easy interface
   for Gnome/Gtk2 and Glade applications using an object-oriented syntax. You just
   make Gtk2::GladeXML::Simple your application's base class, have your C<new> call
   C<SUPER::new>, and the module will do the hard work for you.

   Gtk2::GladeXML::Simple offers:

      * Signal handlers callbacks as methods of your class.
      
      * Autoconnection of signal handlers.

      * Autocalling of creation functions for custom widgets.

      * Access to widgets as instance attributes.
